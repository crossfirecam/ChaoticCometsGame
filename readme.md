Chaotic Comets 1.4.1\
Game made by CrossfireCam (https://crossfirecam.itch.io)

'Chaotic Comets' is an endless space shooter that supports one or two players. Play as a spacecraft tasked with clearing a field of asteroids, constantly on the lookout for enemy aliens that will hurt you and canisters that will help you.

This repository contains the source code for Chaotic Comets, made in Unity and using C# as a scripting language. Feel free to peruse it.
