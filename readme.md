Chaotic Comets
Game made by CrossfireCam (https://gamejolt.com/@CrossfireCam)

This repository contains the source code for Chaotic Comets, made in Unity and using C# as a scripting language. Feel free to peruse it. For a pre-compiled playable game executable, please check out the GameJolt page: https://gamejolt.com/games/chaotic-comets/400816. The current public version is Build 1.2, this repo is hosting changes working toward Build 1.3.

I've been working on this project since October 2018, taking a break from development until March 2019. Since then, I've been working on features and fixing bugs in my spare time. Now all of the new changes I make will be recorded here!

Thanks in advance for trying my game, or just being interested in the code!
