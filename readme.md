Chaotic Comets
Game made by CrossfireCam (https://gamejolt.com/@CrossfireCam)

This repository contains the source code for Chaotic Comets, made in Unity and using C# as a scripting language. Feel free to peruse it. For a pre-compiled playable game executable, please check out the GameJolt page: https://gamejolt.com/games/chaotic-comets/400816. The current version is Build 1.1, this repo is hosting Build 1.2 that's in development.

This repo is in early stages of existing, so later on I will create a branch that contains only major revisions. As well as a branch for commits with incomplete features.

I've been working on this project since October 2018, taking a break from development until March 2019. Since then, I've been working on features and fixing bugs in my spare time. Now all of the new changes I make will be recorded here!

Thanks in advance for trying my game, or just being interested in the code!
