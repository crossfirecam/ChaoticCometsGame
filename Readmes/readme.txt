Chaotic Comets v1.4
Developed by CrossfireCam (https://crossfirecam.itch.io/)

------------------
The Basics
------------------
This is a space shoot-em-up game inspired by Maelstrom and Asterax. Clear levels of asteroids to progress. There's a two player mode, shop for upgrades, interesting enemies, and various temporary powerups.

For an idea of how to play, check out the 'Help' or 'Tutorial' section.

The game can be played with keyboard or controller. Many controllers will work.
Check 'Options' in-game to rebind controls. Go to 'More Info' in this document for details on controller support.

Online multiplayer can be achieved using Parsec - third party software for streaming/players co-op games over the internet. https://parsec.app/

To uninstall this game, delete the entire 'Chaotic Comets' folder.

OS Specific Instructions
------------------
Windows 10 - Smartscreen may block the game from opening. Click 'More info' and 'Run anyway'.

Linux - Game may not work immediately. Go to the executable's 'Properties, Permissions' and check the box for 'Allow executing file as program'.

Mac OS X - Game may not work immediately. Try going to 'System Preferences - Security & Privacy' to allow the game to run.
NOTE: Mac OS X may require third-party drivers to use certain controllers.

------------------
More Info
------------------
All sorts of controllers will work with the game, but buttons may be misplaced because a generic Rewired template was used for controller support. Controls can be rebound manually in-game to better fit your controller.

Known Possible Bugs
------------------
The game is taking focus of keyboard while in other apps:
If key presses in other apps are causing inputs in Chaotic Comets, click back and forth between the windows to fix it.

Note about 2 players on keyboard:
Due to key rollover on some keyboards, both players using keyboard cannot shoot, thrust and rotate all at the same time. The default controls were kept the same due to the low chance of that specific scenario happening. The controls can be changed in Options.

Note about game not continuing past Level 1:
The game relies on save data to load the shop screen and subsequent levels. If after level 1 is over, you find yourself seeing an error dialog, please contact me to help narrow down why the error is caused.
