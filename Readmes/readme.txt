The Basics
------------------
This is a space shoot-em-up game inspired by Maelstrom and Asterax. Clear levels of asteroids to progress. There's a two player mode, shop for upgrades, interesting enemies, and various temporary powerups.

For an idea of how to play, check out the 'Help' or 'Tutorial' section.

The game can be played with keyboard or controller.
Xbox / DualShock 4 / Switch Pro Controller have been set up manually.
However, many controllers will work. Check 'Options' in-game to rebind controls. Go to 'More Info' in this document for details.

Online multiplayer can be achieved using Parsec - third party software for streaming/players co-op games over the internet. https://parsec.app/

OS Specific Instructions
------------------
Windows 10 - Smartscreen may block the game from opening. Click 'More info' and 'Run anyway'.

Linux - Game may not work immediately. Go to the executable's 'Properties, Permissions' and check the box for 'Allow executing file as program'.

Mac OS X - Game may not work immediately. Try going to 'System Preferences - Security & Privacy' to allow the game to run.

More Info
------------------
All sorts of gamepad-style controllers will work with the game, but buttons may be misplaced because a generic Rewired template was used for controller support. Controls can be rebound manually in-game to better fit your controller.
Check the full list of controllers compatible with the generic template here: https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/SupportedControllers.html

Known Possible Bugs
------------------
Note about 2 players on keyboard:
Due to key rollover on some keyboards, players 1 & 2 (both playing on keyboard) cannot shoot, thrust and rotate all at the same time. The default controls were kept the same due to the low chance of that specific scenario happening, and that all other attempts to change the controls felt inconvenient to play with.

Note about game not continuing past Level 1:
The game relies on save data to load the shop screen and subsequent levels. If after level 1 is over, you find yourself back on the main menu, please contact me to help narrow down why the error is caused.
