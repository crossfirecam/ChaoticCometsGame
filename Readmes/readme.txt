Troubleshooting
------------------
GAME NOT STARTING?
- Windows: Smartscreen may block the game from opening. Click 'More info' and 'Run anyway'
- Linux: Permissions may block the game from opening. On Ubuntu for example, go to 'Properties > Permissions' and check the box for 'Allow executing file as program'

CONTROLLER NOT WORKING?
- Check the full list of compatible controllers: https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/SupportedControllers.html
- If a controller's sticks are experiencing drift, visit 'Options > Rebind Controls > Calibrate'
- If using a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, it will not work over USB - you must use the Bluetooth mode to use it
- If both players are using the same keyboard, then some inputs may be dropped due to limitations on most keyboards

SOMETHING ELSE?
- If key presses in other apps are causing inputs in Chaotic Comets, click back and forth between the windows to fix it
- If Parsec isn't accepting connecting player's keyboard or gamepad, visit https://support.parsec.app/hc/en-us/articles/115002702731
