Note about 2 players on keyboard:
Due to key rollover on some keyboards, players 1 & 2 (both playing on keyboard) cannot shoot, thrust and rotate all at the same time. The default controls were kept the same due to the low chance of that specific scenario happening, and that all other attempts to change the controls felt inconvenient to play with.
