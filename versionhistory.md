Chaotic Comets Version History:

2019-06-?? Build 1.2 - Yet to release

2019-05-21 Build 1.1 - Particles, Music & Bug Fixes
Player ship changes:
- Top speed has been greatly reduced for better handling
- Teleport ability has visual cues and invulnerability time
- Thrusters have visual and sound effects
- Can no longer teleport once all asteroids are destroyed, this prevents early vulnerability on next level
Alien ship changes:
- UFO no longer spawns during end level transition, and teleports away if not killed at the end of levels
- UFO cannot grant any more points by the player shooting in its dying state
Other changes:
- Music added, can be disabled from main menu
- All bullets are fading particles instead of static sprites
- Player button controls have been separated. Eg. Shooting is no longer set off by both Space AND controller A button
- Code optimisation - particularly with less strain being placed on per-frame updates
- Player UI layout changed
- Main/Controls/About menu layouts changed
- A note has been added to controls screen. Due to key rollover on some keyboards, players 1 & 2 (both playing on keyboard) cannot shoot, thrust and rotate all at the same time. The default controls were kept the same due to the low chance of that specific scenario happening, and that all other attempts to change the controls felt inconvenient to play with.

2019-03-18 Build 1.0 - Public release of Chaotic Comets
- Changed Main Menu UI, made keyboard/gamepad selection easier
- Changed all UI, compatible with both controller and keyboard
- Difficulty settings added before each game starts. Easy: Auto braking, Normal: Typical braking, Hard: No braking
- Control test screen changed to be in the center of screen and has a pause menu
- Tweaks to shot speed, canteen size, and how ability meter is displayed
- Help/About menu layouts changed
